# Expo Camera Preview Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Camera API where the preview fails to render correctly when asynchronous operations are performed concurrently. This is likely due to a race condition.

## Bug Description
The camera preview intermittently fails to load or displays a blank screen after actions such as network requests or other asynchronous tasks are triggered.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run the `bug.js` example.
2. Observe that after a short period of normal operation, the camera preview fails.
3. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, which avoids the problematic race condition.

## Solution
The solution involves careful management of asynchronous operations and ensuring that the camera's lifecycle is not disrupted by race conditions. This can be achieved by using promises, async/await, and appropriate timing mechanisms.
